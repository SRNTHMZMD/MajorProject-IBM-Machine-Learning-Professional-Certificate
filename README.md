### Major Project - IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate

**Project Title**: Printed Circuit Board Defect Detection
Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the Major Project as part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. The objective of this project is to implement a machine learning model to predict defects in printed circuit boards (PCB) using various data preprocessing and modeling techniques.

Project Objectives
To identify defects in printed circuit boards based on image and sensor data.
Apply machine learning algorithms to classify defects and optimize model accuracy.
Evaluate the performance of models using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of PCB sensor readings and image data. This data has been preprocessed for machine learning models, including handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For classification of defects based on nearest data points.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): For defect classification using hyperplanes.
Random Forest: An ensemble method for improving classification performance.
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall accuracy of the model.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the classification performance for each class.
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score: Metrics used to evaluate the model’s effectiveness in defect detection.
Results
The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 92%, with an F1 score of 0.89.
SVM performed similarly but required more computation time.
